# MAZE.BAS

As I was cleaning up a hard drive full off old, badly organised files, I stumbled on this maze game
I wrote in QBASIC, in, according to the modified-at timestamps, april 2008.

I fired it open in DOSBox, and found I had clearly spent a lot of time on this, since it includes
a maze editor with sprite editor and all. It's written with `SCREEN 13`, in all its 320x240, 256
colour glory.

I'm pushing this as-is for the sake of preserving it.
